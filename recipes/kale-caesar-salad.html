  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Traditional Caesar salad that uses kale instead of romaine!
    Makes 4 side-dish portions, but you can make it a main dish meal by topping it with a grilled protein,
    such as chicken or salmon! You may have leftover dressing, depending on how much you like.
    It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>

    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 bunch kale, ribs removed and leaves torn into pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup Caesar salad croutons</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
